## üí° Code Highlights

The project effectively utilizes advanced React concepts to maintain performance:

### 1. Performance Optimization with `useMemo`

The product filtering logic is wrapped in `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary recalculations of the `filteredProducts` array on every render, ensuring a snappy search experience.

```javascript
// UniversalStore.js
const filteredProducts = useMemo(() => {
  return products.filter((p) => {
    // ... filtering logic
  });
}, [products, search, priceFilter]); // Dependencies ensure re-calculation only when necessary
2. Custom Modal Implementation
A single, dynamic Modal component is used for both viewing product details and adding new items, significantly reducing boilerplate code and improving maintainability.

JavaScript

// Modal Component
const Modal = ({ isOpen, onClose, children, title }) => {
  // ... conditional rendering and shared styles
};

// Usage
<Modal isOpen={modalOpen} onClose={() => setModalOpen(false)}>
  {/* Modal Content */}
</Modal>
